# Crop and fertilizer recommender system using ML
Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System

# Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System that helps farmers select the best crops and fertilizers based on soil and climate conditions. It uses Decision Trees along with data visualization tools to provide accurate recommendations for improving agricultural productivity.

# Features

Crop Recommendation: Suggests the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and weather data.

Fertilizer Recommendation: Recommends the right type and quantity of fertilizer for optimal yield.

Data Visualization: Uses Seaborn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze and present insights.

Real-time Weather Integration: Fetches live weather data for more accurate predictions.

User-friendly Interface: Web-based system using Flask, Django, or Streamlit for easy access.

# Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Machine Learning Model: Decision Trees (Classification & Regression)

Web Frameworks: Flask, Django, Streamlit (For deployment)
